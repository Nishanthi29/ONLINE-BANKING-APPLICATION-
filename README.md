# ONLINE-BANKING-APPLICATION-
 Our Project Online banking Application allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. 
Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.

Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking, available both on desktop versions and through mobile apps.
